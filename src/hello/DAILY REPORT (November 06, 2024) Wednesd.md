DAILY REPORT (November 06, 2024) Wednesday
 Progress:
    - Learnt how to define relationship between tables with/without foreign keys.
    - Configured Redis for cache in NestJS and configured docker for local redis running.
    - Implemented AuthGuard in NestJS for securing specific routes, using JWT for authentication and leveraging APP_GUARD to apply security globally.

 Problem/s:
    - None

 Next Day's Plan:
    - Develop and implement GraphQL APIs in the NestJS application.
    - Write unit tests for key components of the application using Jest to ensure reliability and code quality.

 Learning/Realization:
    -  I really learned a lot about relational database design and how to effectively set up table relationships using TypeORM. I also worked on configuring Redis caching in a NestJS application with Docker, which helped improve its performance. Additionally, I gained insights into implementing JWT-based authentication, utilizing AuthGuard, and applying APP_GUARD for protecting routes in NestJS. Overall, itâ€™s been an enlightening experience!
